      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and prepare 2
      round 8-inch cake pans by lining the bottom with parchment paper and
      spraying well with oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients and
      whisk well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour in the canola oil, applesauce, almond milk
      and vanilla and mix until combined with a large spoon. Now fold in the
      grated carrots.
      <em
        >Be very careful not to over mix the batter, or your cake will come out
        dense and chewy!</em
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour the cake batter evenly between the prepared
      pans, then bake for 35-45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean and
      the tops of the cakes are set. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for
      about 20 minutes before carefully removing from the pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Once cooled completely, frost and then enjoy :)
